# grumblechat 

*A free Google App Engine based chat system*

Created as a free alternative to IRC, Talker, Campfire, etc and as an opportunity to play around with Appengine. There's still a lot of work left to do, but for a small organization it's easy to deploy and very usable. If you'd like to contribute, we welcome patches/forks. See Issues for a list of outstanding features or bugs.

## Getting Started with grumblechat 

All you need is a working Appengine install, instructions can be found here:
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/overview.html

Check out grumblechat, import it as an existing project and then deploy. All deployment-related secrets are handled by the Appengine console.
